Despite his love for Ayre, Duke Zenix's busy schedule left little time for him to truly care for and guide his daughter. Growing up with a lack of attention and understanding of how to properly treat others due to her social status, Ayre became a problematic child who sought attention through imprudence and violence. Despite Duke Zenix's attempts at correcting his daughter's behavior, he was too lenient towards her and she continued down a destructive path. Ayre began wielding her power over anyone who crossed her path until one day she caused serious trouble that even outraged Duke Zenix himself. He knew that something had to be done to correct his daughter's behavior before it was too late.
